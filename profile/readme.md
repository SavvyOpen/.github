Many things can be achieved simply with the right idea.

* SO ChatX – A privacy-first real-time chat system built from scratch using vanilla web technologies.  Designed for self-hosted deployments, strong security, and efficient real-time communication.

* SO Gloper – A unified React library that combines state, logic, and dataflow in an universal namespace system with dual modes (quick setup vs maximum IDE support), dynamic state creation, programmatic API, built-in persistence, lazy loading, auto-immutability, and React 18+ concurrency—letting you build scalable, maintainable apps faster with minimal boilerplate.

* SO Othello – the world’s first Othello app with an unlimited endgame generator, perfect-play solver, interactive play, effortless social sharing, and official recognition by worldothello.org.
